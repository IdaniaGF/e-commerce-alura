# üåø***The vital***

***The vital***  is a fiction e-commerce developed as part of **Alura challenges**.

***The vital*** is a virtual store that offers ecological and sustainable products and services.

The requirements that the store must contain are the following:
* A home page containing a login button and a search engine for products offered by the company.
* A banner containing discounts, promotions or relevant information of the moment.
* A gallery with product information such as image, name, price, and a link to the product description page.
* A product page containing the image, name, description and price.
* A footer with a contact form and other relevant information.
* A login form to authenticate users who want to access the admin menu.
* Extra: login is blocked after three failed attempts.
* Admin menu to add, edit, search or remove products from the store.
* Special screen for editing products.
* All forms have field validation.

The site is responsive, users can access it from their mobile phone.

I worked with the **Trello** tool to manage the activities of each stage of the project.

The design was made by me. The project was developed in its entirety in a time of two weeks.

## ‚úÖ**Project status and road map**
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, there were some extra details that I would have liked to add, but I will surely do so in the future:

* Blocking by user at login (in the current lock the login is blocked, not the user).
* Add functionality so that the customer can evaluate the products.
* Add functionality to buy products online.
* Add functionality to display on the home screen only the most popular articles based on their rating.
* Add animations on every screen change.
